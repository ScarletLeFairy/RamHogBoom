-- Description

The annual tournament has started again! Two tribes, the Hogs and the Rams, are fighting again
for respect, honor and glory. Join one of the tribes and help them to succeed by carrying a
Balldragon into the enemy goal. But beware: the Balldragon is a fragile creature, if you get
too close to a teammate while carrying it, it will literally explode (enemies, on the other
hand, won´t startle it at all)! Also, watch your step: the tournament is held on a plateau
high up in the mountains, so don´t fall. And don´t even dare throwing the sacred Balldragon
from the plateau: thunder god Goatdin himself will otherwise punish you with his thunderbolts!

Lobby
To start the game, both teams have to be even (after three seconds game starts!)
